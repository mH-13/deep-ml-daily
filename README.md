# 🧠 Deep ML Daily Problems

Welcome to my **Daily Deep ML Problem Solving** repository!  
Here I solve **at least 2 deep learning / machine learning problems per day**, with a focus on:

- Matrix operations
- Optimization (gradients, loss functions)
- Neural network components
- Practical ML workflows

Each problem is well-documented and organized
## 📂 Repository Structure

- `problems/` — Daily Python scripts with problem and solution.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for explorations, visualizations, and explanations.
- `utils/` — Common helper functions (if any).
- `requirements.txt` — Required packages (NumPy, matplotlib, etc.)
- `LICENSE` — Open source under MIT or any license of your choice.
